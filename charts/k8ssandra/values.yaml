# -- The cleaner is a pre-delete hook that that ensures objects with finalizers
# get deleted. For example, cass-operator sets a finalizer on the

# finalizers are cleared. In the case of the CassandraDatacenter object,
# cass-operator removes the finalizer. The problem is that there are no
# ordering guarantees with helm uninstall which means that the cass-operator
# deployment could be deleted before the CassandraDatacenter. The cleaner
# ensures that the CassandraDatacenter is deleted before cass-operator.
