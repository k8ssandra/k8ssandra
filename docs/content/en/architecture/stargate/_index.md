Many companies already build applications against Apache Cassandra using the native CQL API. With the release of [Stargate](http://stargate.io/), Cassandra is available to a whole new class of applications through its many data API gateways. Instead of writing CQL, developers may opt for REST, GraphQL, or even document endpoints that are all backed by the high performance and availability of Cassandra. K8ssandra has optional charts for the automated deployment and configuration of Stargate alongside Cassandra data nodes.
