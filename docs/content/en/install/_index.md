  Topics for installing K8ssandra on local (dev) machines or production-level K8ssandra clusters on a variety of cloud platforms.
---

**Tip:** These topics are specific to K8ssandra 1.4.x. Consider exploring our most recent (and recommended) implementation: **K8ssandra Operator**. It includes a `K8ssandraCluster` custom resource and supports single- and **multi-cluster** Cassandra deployments in Kubernetes, for High Availability (HA) capabilities. See the [K8ssandra Operator documentatation](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/install/).
