  Orientation of install topics for v1 K8ssandra and v2 K8ssandra Operator.
---

Welcome! Starting with the introduction of the unified K8ssansdra Operator in March 2022, the install topics are organized as follows:

* For details about the new K8ssandra Operator, see this [local install](https://docs-staging-v2.k8ssandra.io/install/local/) topic. It showcases the K8ssandra Operator support for single- and multi-cluster environments. Examples use local **kind** Kubernetes along with helper scripts invoked by `make` commands, as well as `helm` and `kustomize` options. Topics covering installs that use K8ssandra Operator for Google GKE, Amazon EKS, and Azure AKS may be added at a later time. 

* For details about using the original K8ssandra (1.4.x) project, start on this [introductory page](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/). It provides links to the following topics for single-cluster installs:
  * [Local K8s](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/local/)
  * [Amazon EKS](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/eks)
  * [Azure AKS](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/aks/)
  * [DigitalOcean DOKS](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/doks/)
  * [Google GKE](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/install/gke/)
  * [Post-install steps for developers](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/quickstarts/developer/)
  * [Post-install steps for SREs](https://docs-staging-v1.k8ssandra.io/quickstarts/site-reliability-engineer/)
