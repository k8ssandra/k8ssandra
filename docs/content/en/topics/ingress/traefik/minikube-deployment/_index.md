Minikube is a popular tool for testing k8s clusters locally. When deploying to Minikube, we use the native Kubernetes `port-forward` command from `kubectl` in order to access the services. 

### 1. Install Minikube and start the cluster

Installation instructions for Minikube are [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Once installed, running `minikube start` will bring up a local cluster.

### 2. Install Traefik via Helm

Traefik can be installed via Helm in conjunction with the below Traefik values file - 

### [`Traefik Values`](traefik-values.yaml)

The `traefik-values.yaml` file referenced here is located in:

https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/blob/main/docs/content/en/docs/topics/ingress/traefik/minikube-deployment/traefik-values.yaml
 
{{< readfilerel file="traefik-values.yaml"  highlight="yaml" >}}

It can be applied to the cluster using the below commands. 

```
$ helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
$ helm repo update
$ helm install traefik traefik/traefik -n traefik --create-namespace -f traefik.values.yaml
NAME: traefik
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Nov 12 16:59:40 2020
NAMESPACE: traefik
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

### 3. Port forward to the Traefik dashboard

Assuming you have used the above configuration, Traefik will have been installed into a new namespace called `traefik`. The Traefik dashboard can now be accessed using `kubectl port-forward --namespace traefik services/traefik 9000:9000`

Minikube offers several options to access a service from the host machine (including via a NodePort on the Minikube host). Additional information can be found in the Minikube [documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/). Note that it is sometimes preferable to access services via `port-forward` as this is closer to the way that services are accessed on a remote cluster.

### Note - these settings are not suitable for production.

The steps above will create a NodePort service which will serve the Traefik dashboard to clients outside the k8s cluster. This is not suitable for deployment to cloud platforms (EKS, AKS, GKE etc.) as it will make the dashboard publicly available on any external IPs attached to the node. (Albeit only if access is provided by any security group or firewall on the cluster.) For a cloud-ready configuration, we should ensure that the Traefik dashboard and other internal services are not visible from outside the cluster (except via `port-forward` as above).
