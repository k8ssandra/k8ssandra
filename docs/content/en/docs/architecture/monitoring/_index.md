  How do you know if your cluster is healthy?
---

When running applications in Kubernetes observability is key. With K8ssandra and cass-operator, each Apache CassandraÂ® pod is configured with the DataStax [Metrics Collector for Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/datastax/metric-collector-for-apache-cassandra). This exposes Cassandra node-level metrics in the Prometheus format covering everything from operations per second and latency to compaction throughput and heap usage.

K8ssandra goes a step further providing a deployment of Prometheus and Grafana for the storage and visualization of these metrics including:

* Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` resource with Metric Relabeling directed at the
  K8ssandra cluster's Service
* Grafana `DataSource` resource configured to reference the deployed Prometheus
  instance
* Grafana `Dashboard` resources

## Metric Data Retention

Metric data collected in the cluster is retained within Prometheus for 24 hours.
