K8ssandra provides a production-ready platform for running Apache Cassandra&reg; on Kubernetes. This includes automation for operational tasks such as repairs, backup and restores, and monitoring. 

Also deployed is Stargate, an open source data gateway that lets you interact programmatically with your Kubernetes-hosted Cassandra resources via a well-defined API. 

The **K8ssandra 1.1.0** release implements a number of key changes, enhancements, and bug fixes, as noted below. For the complete list, see [CHANGELOG-110.md](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
