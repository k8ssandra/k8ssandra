description: How to migrate an existing Cassandra cluster that's running in Kubernetes to K8ssandra.
---

The strategy to perform this migration to K8ssandra focuses on a datacenter migration.

## The environment

It's assumed that the Cassandra cluster is running in the same Kubernetes cluster in which K8ssandra will run. The Cassandra cluster may have been installed with another operator (such as [CassKop](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/casskop)), a Helm chart (such as [bitnami/cassandra](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/cassandra)), or by directly creating the YAML manfiests for the StatefulSets and any other objects that were created.

## Check the replication strategies of keyspaces

Confirm that the user-defined keyspaces and each of the `system_auth`, `system_distributed`, and `system_traces` are using `NetworkTopologyStrategy`.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
The `system_*` keyspaces include `system_auth`, `system_schema`, `system_distributed`, and `system_traces`.
{{% /alert %}}

It is generally recommended to use a replicator factor of `3`. If your keyspaces currently use `SimpleStrategy` and assuming you have at least 3 Cassandra nodes, then you would change the replication factor for `system_auth` as follows:

```cql
ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 3}
```

`dc1` is the name of the datacenter as defined in `cassandra-rackdc.properties`, which you can find in the `/etc/cassandra/` directory of your Cassandra installation.


Changing the recommendation may result in a topology change; that is, a token ownership change. 

{{% alert title="Recommendation" color="success" %}}
If you change the replication strategy of a keyspace, run a full, cluster-wide repair on it using whatever solution you have for scheduling and running repairs. If you do not already have another solution, you can run `nodetool repair -full` on each Cassandra node, one at a time. Repairs can be both time consuming and resource intensive. It is best to run them during a scheduled maintenance window.

## Check the endpoint snitch

Make sure that `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch` is used, and not `SimpleSnitch`.

{{% alert title="Recommendation" color="success" %}}
If you change the snitch, run a full, cluster-wide repair.

## Client changes

Make sure client services are using a `LoadBalancingPolicy` that will route requests to the local datacenter. Also make sure your clients are using `LOCAL_*` and not `QUORUM` consistency levels.  

Here is an example `application.conf` file for version 4.11 of the Java driver that configures the `LoadBalancingPolicy` and the default consistency level:

```conf
# application.conf

datastax-java-driver {
    basic.load-balancing-policy {
        local-datacenter = dc1
    }

    basic.request {
        consistency = LOCAL_QUORUM
    }
}
```

## Install K8ssandra

Before installing K8ssandra, make a note of the IP addresses of the seed nodes of the current datacenter. You will use the following to configure the `additionalSeeds` property in the k8ssandra chart. Here is an example chart properties overrides file named `k8ssandra-values.yaml` that we can use to install k8ssandra:

```yaml
#k8ssandra-values.yaml
#
# Note this only demonstrates usage of the additionalSeeds property.
# Refer to the chart documentation for other properties you may want
# to configure.
cassandra:
  # The cluster name needs to match the cluster name in the original
  # datacenter.
  clusterName: cassandra
  datacenters:
  - name: dc2
    size: 3
  additionalSeeds:
  # The following should be replaced with actual IP addresses or
  # hostnames of pods in the original datacenter.
  - <dc1-seed>
  - <dc1-seed>
  - <dc1-seed>
```

Install k8ssandra as follows. Replace `my-k8ssandra` with whatever name you prefer:

```bash
helm install my-k8ssandra k8ssandra/k8ssandra -f k8ssandra-values.yaml
```

Run `nodetool status <keyspace-name>` to verify that the nodes in the new datacenter are gossiping with the old datacenter. For the keyspace argument, you can specify a user-defined one or `system_auth`.  Here is some example output:

```bash
nodetool status system_auth
```

**Output:**

```bash

```

You should expect to see 0.0% ownership for the nodes in the new datacenter. This is because we are not yet replicating to the new datacenter.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
If you run `nodetool status` without the keyspace argument, you may find that nodes in the new datacenter report something greater than 0.0% for the token ownership. This happens because, when Stargate is installed, a keyspace named `data_endpoint_auth` is created.
{{% /alert %}}

## Update replication strategy

For each keyspace that uses `NetworkTopologyStrategy`, update the replication strategy to include the new datacenter as follows:

```cql
ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc1': 3, 'dc2': 3}
```

Run the same `nodetool status` command that you ran previously. You should see that the token ownership has changed for the nodes in the new datacenter.

At this point nodes in the new datacenter will start receiving writes.

## Stream data to the new nodes

Next you need to stream data from the original datacenter to the new datacenter to get the latter caught up with past writes. This can be done with the `nodetool rebuild` command. It needs to be run on each node in the new datacenter as follows:

```bash
nodetool rebuild <old-datacenter-name>
```

## Stop sending traffic to the old datacenter

To stop sending traffic to the old datacenter, there are two steps:

1. Route clients to the new datacenter
2. Update replication strategies

### Route clients to the new datacenter

Update the `LoadBalancingPolicy` of client services to route requests to the new datacenter. Here is an example for v4.11 of the Java driver where the new datacenter is named dc2:

```yaml
# application.conf

datastax-java-driver {
    basic.load-balancing-policy {
        local-datacenter = dc2
    }

    basic.request {
        consistency = LOCAL_QUORUM
    }
}
```

{{% alert title="Recommendation" color="success" %}}
Verify that there are no client connections to nodes in the old datacenter.
{{% /alert %}}

### Update replication strategies

Next we need to stop replicating data to nodes in the old datacenter. For each keyspace that was previously updated, we need to update it again. This time we will remove the old datacenter. 

Here is an example that specifies the `system_auth keyspace`:

```cql
ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'dc2': 3}
```

## Remove the old datacenter

Now we are ready to do some cleanup and remove the old datacenter and associated resources that are no longer in use. There are three steps:

1. Decommission nodes
2. Remove old seed nodes
3. Delete old datacenter resources from Kubernetes

### Decommission nodes

Run the following on each node in the old datacenter:

```bash
nodetool decommission
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
Decommissioning should be done serially, one node at a time.
{{% /alert %}}

### Remove the old seed nodes

Remove the seeds nodes from the `additionalSeeds` chart property. You can simply remove the `additionaSeeds` property from the chart overrides file (see again the sample file shown in the [Install K8ssandra](#install-k8ssandra) section above). Edit your version of the values file, and then run a `helm upgrade` for the changes to take effect. Assuming that the edited chart properties are stored in `k8ssandra-values.yaml`:

```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> k8ssandra/k8ssandra -f k8ssandra-values.yaml
```

The command above will trigger a statefulset update, which in effect is a cluster-wide (with respect to Cassandra) rolling restart.

### Delete the old datacenter resources from Kubernetes

The steps necessary here will vary depending on how you installed and managed the old datacenter. You want to make sure that the StatefulSets, PersistentVolumeClaims, PersistentVolumes, and any other objects created in association with the old datacenter are deleted in the Kubernetes cluster.
