  Setting up TLS to Traefik Ingress
---

It integrates with your existing infrastructure components and configures itself
automatically and dynamically. Traefik handles advanced ingress deployments
including mTLS of TCP with SNI and UDP. Operators define rules for routing
traffic to downstream systems through Kubernetes `Ingress` objects or more
specific `Custom Resource Definitions`. K8ssandra supports deploying
`IngressRoute` objects as part of a deployment to expose metrics, repair, and
Cassandra interfaces.
