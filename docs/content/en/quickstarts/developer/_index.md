Welcome! Depending on which version you're using, follow the post-install steps for developers in:

* [docs-v1.k8ssandra.io](https://docs-v1.k8ssandra.io/quickstarts/developer/) is for K8ssandra 1.4.x users (the initial project releases).

* [docs-v2.k8ssandra.io](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/quickstarts/developer/) is for users of our recent (and recommended) K8ssandra Operator software, including single- or multi-cluster installs, post-installs, and related tasks.

**Tip:** From each page's top banner, use the **Versions** menu to navigate to the Common, v1, or v2 documentation Home.
