---

The open-source K8ssandra project provides a production-ready platform for running Apache Cassandra&reg; on Kubernetes. This functionality includes automation for operational tasks such as repairs, backup and restores, and monitoring. Also deployed is Stargate, an open source data gateway that lets you interact programmatically with your Kubernetes-hosted Cassandra resources via a well-defined API. 

## Latest releases

* K8ssandra Operator 1.0.0, released 17-Feb-2022
* K8ssandra 1.4.1, released 02-December-2021

## New &amp; noteworthy

**K8ssandra Operator** is our latest implementation. It provides a cloud-native distribution of Cassandra that runs on Kubernetes. Significantly, K8ssandra Operator provides a new `K8ssandraCluster` custom resource that enables support for single- or **multi-cluster, multi-region** deployments of Cassandra and related services. It's all part of the overall K8ssandra project, but you'll need to deploy with K8ssandra Operator to use the latest multi-cluster/region features. For details, start in the K8ssandra Operator [install topics](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/install/). You'll find there topics for single- and multi-cluster instructions that use Helm or Kustomize tools.

For more, see the [K8ssandra Operator architecture](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/components/k8ssandra-operator/architecture/).

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes environment from v1.17 (minimum supported) up to v1.22 (current tested upper bound) - local or via a supported cloud provider
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3.5.x or later. Recommendation: avoid Helm 3.7.0 due to a known CVE and subsequent regression. See issue [1103](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1103) in GitHub.
* Additional prereqs are listed in the K8ssandra Operator [install](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/install/) topic.
