K8ssandra provides a production-ready platform for running Apache Cassandra&reg; on Kubernetes. This includes automation for operational tasks such as repairs, backup and restores, and monitoring. Also deployed is Stargate, an open source data gateway that lets you interact programmatically with your Kubernetes-hosted Cassandra resources via a well-defined API. 

**Latest release:** K8ssandra 1.3.1

Release date: 27-August-2021

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes environment, from v1.17 (minimum supported), up to v1.21.1 (current tested upper bound) - local or via a supported cloud provider
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3. Note that K8ssandra 1.3.x has been tested with Helm v3.5.3. Recommendation: specifically avoid Helm 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 due to a known CVE and subsequent regression. Our testing will resume with Helm v3.6.2 and later. Related: see GH issue [1103](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1103).

* medusa-operator 0.3.3
* Reaper for Apache Cassandra 2.2.5
* reaper-operator 2.3.0

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Thus, for example, "Reaper Operator" deploys and configures Reaper. "Reaper" itself manages the actual Cassandra repair operations. Similarly, "Prometheus Operator" deploys and configures Prometheus. "Prometheus" itself manages the actual collection of relevant OS / Cassandra metrics. "Medusa Operator" configures and orchestrates the backup and restore operations. "Medusa" itself runs the container that performs backups of Cassandra data.

## Upgrade notices

Before upgrading to the latest K8ssandra release, be sure to read the sections below.

### Upgrading to K8ssandra 1.3.0 and Cassandra 4.0

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Good news! The issue described in this section was **fixed in K8ssandra 1.3.1**; refer to resolved issue [1029](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1029).
{{% /alert %}}

When you upgrade from a prior K8ssandra release to 1.3.0 or 1.3.1, the default `cassandra.version` is `4.0.0`. Specifically in the case of upgrading from a prior K8ssandra release to **K8ssandra 1.3.0 and Cassandra 4.0.0**, a changed Cassandra `num_tokens` default may prevent Cassandra 4.0 from starting. This section explains how to avoid the issue for 1.3.0 users. 

First, some background information. The default value for `num_tokens` in Cassandra 3.11 is 256. The default in Cassandra 4.0 is 16. All nodes are assigned the same number of tokens based on the `num_tokens` setting. More tokens means that the ring is divided up into smaller ranges. A larger number of tokens means that each individual range will be smaller.

As noted for this K8ssandra 1.3.0 upgrade scenario, in issue [1029](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1029), the Cassandra logs will include the following error, and Cassandra will not start:

```
org.apache.cassandra.exceptions.ConfigurationException: Cannot change the number of tokens from 256 to 16
```

To avoid the issue, first check the `num_tokens` settings in your K8ssandra-deployed Cassandra 3.11 database. Let's walk through an example.

#### Initial installation

This example starts by installing K8ssandra 1.3.0 with Cassandra 3.11.11 and the latter's default `num_tokens` (256). 

```bash
helm install k8ssandra -f k8ssandra.values.yml k8ssandra/k8ssandra
```

k8ssandra.values.yml:

```yaml
cassandra:
  version: "3.11.11"
  datacenters:
    - 
      name: dc1
      size: 1
```

**Resulting deployment:**

```bash
helm list
```
**Output**:
```
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
k8ssandra       default         1               2021-07-27 18:58:03.831212 -0400 EDT    deployed        k8ssandra-1.3.0 
```

After about 10 minutes, verify the Cassandra Operator status:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "Cassandra Operator Progress:"
```
**Output**:
```
  Cassandra Operator Progress:  Ready
```

Verify the server version:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "Server Version:" 
```
**Output**:
```
  Server Version:  3.11.11
```

Verify the `num_tokens`, in this case defined by default value:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "num_tokens:"
```
**Output**:
```
      num_tokens:                         256
```

#### Upgrades

Upgrade to Cassandra 4.0.0 and explicitly sets the `num_tokens` to match the previous default (256).

```bash
helm upgrade k8ssandra -f k8ssandra-upgrade.values.yml k8ssandra/k8ssandra
```

k8ssandra-upgrade.values.yml:

```yaml
cassandra:
  version: "4.0.0"
  datacenters:
    - 
      name: dc1
      size: 1
      num_tokens: 256
```

**Resulting deployment:**

After about 10 minutes, verify the Cassandra Operator status:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "Cassandra Operator Progress:"                              
```
**Output**:
```
  Cassandra Operator Progress:  Ready
```

Check the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
**Output**:
```
NAME                                                READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
k8ssandra-cass-operator-5bbf6584b9-pgldj            1/1     Running     0          9m23s

k8ssandra-grafana-679b4bbd74-ngrz2                  2/2     Running     0          9m23s
k8ssandra-kube-prometheus-operator-85695ffb-qhqc7   1/1     Running     0          9m23s
k8ssandra-reaper-694cf49b96-jgnvg                   0/1     Running     1          6m12s
k8ssandra-reaper-operator-5c6cc55869-tdhjw          1/1     Running     0          9m23s
prometheus-k8ssandra-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0   2/2     Running     1          9m14s
```

Verify the server version:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "Server Version:" 
```
**Output**:
```
  Server Version:  4.0.0
```

Verify `num_tokens`:

```bash
kubectl describe cassdc dc1 | grep "num_tokens:"
```
**Output**:
```
      num_tokens:                         256
```

Because the explicitly set `num_tokens` value in 4.0 matches the previous `num_tokens` default in 3.11 (256), Cassandra starts. 

### Upgrading from K8ssandra 1.0.0 to 1.3.1 

Upgrading directly from K8ssandra 1.0.0 to 1.3.1 causes a `StatefulSet` update, due to issues [#533](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/533) and [#613](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/613)). A `StatefulSet` update has the effect of a rolling restart. Because of issue [#411](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/411), this could require you to perform a manual restart of all Stargate nodes after the Cassandra cluster is back online. This behavior also impacts in-place restore operations of Medusa backups - see issue [#611](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/611). 

To manually restart Stargate nodes:

1. Get the Deployment object in your Kubernetes environment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment | grep stargate
   ```
2. Scale down with this command:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment <stargate-deployment> --replicas 0
   ```
3. Run this next command and wait until it reports 0/0 ready replicas. This should happen within a couple seconds.
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment <stargate-deployment>
   ```
4. Now scale up with:
   ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment <stargate-deployment> --replicas 1
    ```

## K8ssandra 1.2.0 revisions

Release date: 02-June-2021

The following sections briefly summarize and link to key developments in K8ssandra 1.2.0. For the latest list, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/blob/main/CHANGELOG-1.2.md).  

### Changes

* Upgrade to Cassandra 4.0-rc1 [#726](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/726).

### New features

{{% alert title="Tips" color="success" %}} 
In Kubernetes, **node affinity** is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, as a preference or a hard requirement. **Taints** are the opposite. They allow a node to repel a set of pods. **Tolerations** are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node. Once applied, the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints. For more, see [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) in the Kubernetes.io documentation.
