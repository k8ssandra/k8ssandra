K8ssandra provides a production-ready platform for running Apache Cassandra&reg; on Kubernetes. This includes automation for operational tasks such as repairs, backup and restores, and monitoring. Also deployed is Stargate, an open source data gateway that lets you interact programmatically with your Kubernetes-hosted Cassandra resources via a well-defined API. 

**Latest release:** K8ssandra 1.4.0

Release date: 19-November-2021

{{% alert title="Note" color="success" %}}
**K8ssandra 1.4.0** implements a number of changes, enhancements, and bug fixes. This topic summarizes the key revisions in 1.4.0 and prior 1.x releases, provides links to the associated issues in our GitHub repo, and contains important upgrade considerations.

**Reminder**: We've migrated the cass-operator GitHub repo from https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator to https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator. Refer to the new repo for the latest Cass Operator developments.

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes environment from v1.17 (minimum supported) up to v1.22 (current tested upper bound) - local or via a supported cloud provider
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) v3. Note that K8ssandra 1.4.0 has been tested with Helm v3.5.3. Recommendation: specifically avoid Helm 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 due to a known CVE and subsequent regression. Our testing will resume with Helm v3.6.2 and later. Related: see GH issue [1103](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1103).

## Supported Kubernetes environments

* Open-source [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

* [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) (DOKS)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) (GKE)
* [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS)
* [MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)
* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

## K8ssandra deployed components

The K8ssandra helm chart deploys the following components. Some are optional, and depending on the configuration, may not be deployed:

* [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) - the deployed version depends on the configured `cassandra.version` setting:
  * 4.0.1 (default)
  * 3.11.11
  * 3.11.10
  * 3.11.9
  * 3.11.8
  * 3.11.7
* [cass-operator](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator)) 1.9.0.
* Management API for Apache Cassandra ([MAAC](https://github.com/datastax/management-api-for-apache-cassandra)) 0.1.27
* [Stargate](https://github.com/stargate/stargate) 1.0.40
* Metric Collector for Apache Cassandra ([MCAC](https://github.com/datastax/metric-collector-for-apache-cassandra)) 0.2.0
* kube-prometheus-stack 12.11.3 [chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
* Medusa for Apache Cassandra 0.11.0
* medusa-operator 0.3.3
* Reaper for Apache Cassandra 2.2.5
* reaper-operator 2.3.0

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Thus, for example, "Reaper Operator" deploys and configures Reaper. "Reaper" itself manages the actual Cassandra repair operations. Similarly, "Prometheus Operator" deploys and configures Prometheus. "Prometheus" itself manages the actual collection of relevant OS / Cassandra metrics. "Medusa Operator" configures and orchestrates the backup and restore operations. "Medusa" itself runs the container that performs backups of Cassandra data.

## Upgrade notices

{{% alert title="Tip" color="success" %}}
Previously in K8ssandra 1.3.x, an issue with the `num_tokens` setting required that you match the value from Cassandra 3.11.x with `num_tokens` in Cassandra 4.0.x. That issue was resolved in K8ssandra 1.3.1 by [1029](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/1029).

### Upgrading from K8ssandra 1.0.0 to 1.4.0

Upgrading directly from K8ssandra 1.0.0 to 1.4.0 causes a `StatefulSet` update, due to issues [#533](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/533) and [#613](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/613)). A `StatefulSet` update has the effect of a rolling restart. Because of issue [#411](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/411), this could require you to perform a manual restart of all Stargate nodes after the Cassandra cluster is back online. This behavior also impacts in-place restore operations of Medusa backups - see issue [#611](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/611). 

To manually restart Stargate nodes:

1. Get the Deployment object in your Kubernetes environment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment | grep stargate
   ```
2. Scale down with this command:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment <stargate-deployment> --replicas 0
   ```
3. Run this next command and wait until it reports 0/0 ready replicas. This should happen within a couple seconds.
   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment <stargate-deployment>
   ```
4. Now scale up with:
   ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment <stargate-deployment> --replicas 1
    ```

## K8ssandra 1.2.0 revisions

Release date: 02-June-2021

The following sections briefly summarize and link to key developments in K8ssandra 1.2.0. For the latest list, refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/blob/main/CHANGELOG-1.2.md).  

### Changes

* Upgrade to Cassandra 4.0-rc1 [#726](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/726).

### New features

* Make tolerations configurable [#673](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/673), [#698](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/698). 
{{% alert title="Tips" color="success" %}} 
In Kubernetes, **node affinity** is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes, as a preference or a hard requirement. **Taints** are the opposite. They allow a node to repel a set of pods. **Tolerations** are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node. Once applied, the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints. For more, see [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) in the Kubernetes.io documentation.

### Enhancements

* Add the ability to attach additional Persistent Volumes (PVs) for Medusa backups [#560](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/560).

* Upgrade to Medusa 0.10.1 fixing failed backups after a restore [#678](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra/issues/678).
