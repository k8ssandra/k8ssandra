Welcome! Depending on which version you're using, follow the steps in these task-oriented topics on:

* [docs-v2.k8ssandra.io](https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/tasks/) provides topics that are specific to the more recent (and recommended) K8ssandra Operator software, including single- or multi-cluster installs, post-installs, and related tasks.

* [docs-v1.k8ssandra.io](https://docs-v1.k8ssandra.io/tasks/) provides topics that are specific to K8ssandra 1.4.x users (the initial project releases).

**Tip:** From each page's top banner, use the **Versions** menu to navigate to the Common, v1, or v2 documentation Home.
