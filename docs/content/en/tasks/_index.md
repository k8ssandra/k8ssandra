description: Task-based topics to help you get things done in your Kubernetes cluster.

These tasks build on the K8ssandraCluster [local install]({{< relref "/install/local" >}}) topic. If you haven't already, follow those steps.

Accessing resources from outside of the K8ssandraCluster requires tooling to make the internal resources available at external connection points. This may be accomplished through a number of means, many explored here. Some of the tasks assume a Kubernetes Ingress Controller has been installed and configured. If you need help with that setup, head over to the [Traefik ingress]({{< relref "/tasks/connect/ingress" >}}) section and explore these topics.
