K3d automatically deploys the Traefik ingress controller when the cluster is started. Unfortunately, it is not configured to accept traffic on ports other than 80. 

For our purposes it is best to _skip_ the automatic Traefik installation and install it ourselves via Helm. 

This topic walks through standing up a K3d cluster on MacOS with Traefik configured for ingress on ports other than the standard `80` and `443`.

## 1. Bootstrap K3d _without_ Traefik

Beyond simply disabling Traefik, we must also pre-plan the ports that should be forwarded into our cluster. K3d spins up a minimum of two containers for a given cluster. One of which is a load-balancer that handles routing / proxying requests to all other nodes in the cluster. Since k3d uses docker to deploy the underlying k3s services, the inbound ports will be mapped from the docker host IP to the load balancer container. For our purposes the following ports will be opened:

* `80` - HTTP traffic - This is used for accessing the metrics and repair user
  interfaces
* `443` - HTTPS traffic - Useful when accessing the metrics and repair
  interfaces in a secure manner
* `9000` - Traefik dashboard - **WARNING** this should only be done in
  development environments. Higher level environments should use `kubectl
  port-forward`.
* `9042` - C* traffic - Insecure Cassandra traffic. _Note:_ Without TLS (more
  specifically SNI) Traefik may **not** be able to distinguish traffic across
  cluster boundaries. If you are in an environment where more than one cluster
  is deployed you **must** add additional ports here.
* `9142` - C* TLS traffic - Secure Cassandra traffic, multiple clusters may run
  behind this single port.
* `8080` - Stargate GraphQL API
* `8081` - Stargate Authorization REST API
* `8082` - Stargate CRUD REST API

```bash
$ k3d cluster create \
  --k3s-server-arg "--no-deploy" \
  --k3s-server-arg "traefik" \
  --port "80:32080@loadbalancer" \
  --port "443:32443@loadbalancer" \
  --port "9000:32090@loadbalancer" \
  --port "9042:32091@loadbalancer" \
  --port "9142:32092@loadbalancer" \
  --port "8880:30080@loadbalancer" \
  --port "8881:30081@loadbalancer" \
  --port "8882:30082@loadbalancer"
INFO[0000] Created network 'k3d-k3s-default'            
INFO[0000] Created volume 'k3d-k3s-default-images'      
INFO[0001] Creating node 'k3d-k3s-default-server-0'     
INFO[0001] Creating LoadBalancer 'k3d-k3s-default-serverlb' 
INFO[0007] Cluster 'k3s-default' created successfully!  
INFO[0007] You can now use it like this:                
kubectl cluster-info
```
We now have a Kubernetes cluster running with a load balancer bound to the ports we specified. The next step is creating the service routing inside the Kubernetes cluster. 

## 2. Create Traefik Helm values file

Note the service type of `NodePort`. It is used here as it is the port _on the
Docker container running k3d_ which is forwarded to our docker host ip.

### [`traefik.values.yaml`](traefik.values.yaml)

The `traefik.values.yaml` file is [here](traefik.values.yaml).

{{< readfilerel file="traefik.values.yaml"  highlight="yaml" >}}

## 3. Install Traefik via Helm

```bash
$ helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
$ helm repo update
$ helm install traefik traefik/traefik -n traefik --create-namespace -f traefik.values.yaml
NAME: traefik
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Apr 22 16:59:40 2020
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

## 4. Access Traefik Dashboard

With the deployment complete we can verify the service is now running.
This may be accomplished with:

```bash
$ kubectl get services -n traefik
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                   AGE
traefik   LoadBalancer   10.43.75.223   <none>        9042:32091/TCP,9142:32092/TCP,9000:32090/TCP,80:32080/TCP,443:32443/TCP   4m2s
```

When k3d creates the cluster, docker takes our port mapping and creates the external port routing to the host ip address. For this environment the Traefik dashboard is at 
[http://localhost:9000/dashboard/](http://localhost:9000/dashboard/). Example:
