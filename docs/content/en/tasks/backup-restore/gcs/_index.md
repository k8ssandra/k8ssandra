Medusa is a Cassandra backup and restore tool. It's packaged with K8ssandra and supports a variety of backends, including GCS for storage in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environments.

## Introduction

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a RESTful online file storage web service for storing and accessing data on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / GKE infrastructure. The service combines the performance and scalability of Google's cloud with advanced security and sharing capabilities.

For information about GCS, see the [Google Cloud Storage documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage).
