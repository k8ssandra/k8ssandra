Welcome! Depending on which version you're using, see the following reference topics.

* https://docs-v2.k8ssandra.io/reference/ is for users of our recent (and recommended) K8ssandra Operator software, including single- or multi-cluster deployments. The reference topics here include Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and the single K8ssandra Operator Helm chart.

* https://docs-v1.k8ssandra.io/reference/ is for K8ssandra 1.4.x users (the initial project releases).
