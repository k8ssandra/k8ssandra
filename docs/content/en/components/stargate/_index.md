Stargate is deployed by K8ssandra as part of its Helm chart install. If you haven't already, see the [quickstart]({{< relref "/quickstarts/" >}}) and [install]({{< relref "/install" >}}) topics.

## Introduction

Stargate is an open source data gateway that sits between your app and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.

Stargate is a framework used to customize all aspects of data access. It is deployed between client applications and a database to provide an abstraction layer that can be used to shape your data access to fit your application's needs.
