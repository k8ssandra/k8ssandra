# This example shows off most customization options Cass Operator offers. It's
# built to run on a 6 node regional GKE 1.15.x cluster in the us-central1 region
# with a node pool covering the a, b, and c zones. Data will be stored in a
# rack-safe way across the zones, and it's expected the user will be using RF=3
# keyspaces. The request/limts/configuration is based on k8s worker nodes with
# at least 8 CPUs and 30 GB RAM, but these numbers can be adjusted.
