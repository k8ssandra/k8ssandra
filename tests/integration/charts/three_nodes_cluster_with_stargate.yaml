    # the cluster's contactPoints, and thereafter communicate to the cluster using those names/IPs rather than whatever host was specified to the client. In
    # order for clients to work correctly through ingress with a host filter, this means that the host filter must match the hostnames specified in the
    # contactPoints. This value must be a DNS-resolvable hostname and not an IP address. To avoid this issue, leave this setting blank, or override it to ""
    # (empty string) for stargate.ingress.cassandra.host. This note does not apply to clients of Stargate's auth, REST, or GraphQL APIs.
